## What to do if an error occurs?
### If an error occurs the reason for that might be the paths used in our code.So you will have to update the paths.
#### Step 1) get the absolute path of messageDatabase.txt and the files you have to add this path to are: clientGUI.java
#### Step 2) get the absolute path of userDatabase.txt and the files you have to add this path to are: Login.java
#### Step 3) get the absolute path of whisper.png and the files you have to add this path to are: Login.java
### Now recompile your code and make sure you have added the absolute path for each file.
